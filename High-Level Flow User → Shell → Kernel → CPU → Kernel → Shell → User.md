🧠 High-Level Flow: User → Shell → Kernel → CPU → Kernel → Shell → User
1. 👤 User Input
You type a command like ls -l and press Enter.

2. 🐚 Shell Processing
The shell (e.g., bash, zsh) parses your command.

It checks for built-in commands, variable substitutions, or external programs.

If it's an external program (ls in this case), the shell:

Searches for it in $PATH

Prepares system calls to request execution

3. 🧰 System Call to Kernel
The shell makes a system call like execve() to request the kernel to:

Load the ls program

Allocate memory and resources

Assign a new process ID (PID)

4. 🧠 Kernel Takes Over
The Linux kernel performs:

Program loading: loads the binary into memory

Memory management: sets up a virtual address space

File descriptor setup: for standard input/output

Scheduling: decides when the process gets CPU time

5. ⚙️ CPU Execution
The scheduler picks the process (ls) and assigns it to a CPU core.

The CPU executes machine instructions:

Reads directory entries

Formats output

Writes results to standard output (usually the terminal)

6. 🔁 Syscalls Back to Kernel
While running, the ls program uses system calls to:

Access the filesystem (e.g., open(), read())

Write output (write() syscall)

These syscalls transition control back and forth between user space and kernel space.

7. 📤 Kernel to Shell
Once the ls command finishes:

The kernel notifies the shell it has completed (via SIGCHLD signal)

The shell collects the exit status using wait()

8. 🖥️ Shell Displays Output
The output of ls is already printed to the terminal (handled during execution).

The shell is now ready to take your next command, showing the prompt again.
